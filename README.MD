The project is in the process of designing and working on it, fetching it would mean you would be using code that does not work!

However, be sure to add to it by pull requests or so

The idea of the project is to traverse the tree starting from the root directory and restart http server according to changes in the project (again, starting from root directory)

It uses General Tree and DFS, as well as a Queue under the hood and some JSON configuration.

Overall, been a huge lesson and still is learning a lot.

Want to express that I have huge desire to make it a linux cli application, however yet to be done.

Write here if you have any questions: nazikkaniuka@gmail.com

Thanks,
Naz
